# MAQMS
 Mobile Air Quality Monitoring System (MAQMS) - An IoT Network of Air Quality Monitoring stations connected to Azure cloud to provide insights and predictive models of air quality in Mexico City.
 
 The scope of the project is to measure and create predictive models of air quality in Mexico City but can be replicated in any city with a 3G/4G Network coverage.

 ## Abstract
 
 This work describes the design and implementation of a system capable of create predictive models based on machine learning techniques using mobile air quality monitoring modules that sense pollution contaminants at street level, currently street level pollution data is not available since the Mexico City monitoring network measures air quality index at heights of 3 meters. There are two types of modules, the first is fixed at street level in public spaces whereas the second is mounted on a vehicle to obtain a better Air Quality Index samples in the city. Data is transmitted in real time using 4G coverage area network implementing IoT (Internet of Things) to store the data on the cloud for later processing using machine learning techniques that will help to create predictive models and therefore being able to provide a new alternative of air quality monitoring through new technologies in Mexico City.
